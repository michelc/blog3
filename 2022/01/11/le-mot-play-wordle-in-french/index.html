<p>TL;TR : Let me <a href="https://www.solitaire-play.com/lemot/">play Wordle in French</a>!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some time ago, I saw some funny pictures appear on Twitter. It looked a bit like GitHub's contributions, but over a single week?</p>
<p>I finally figured out what it was and discovered <a href="https://powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/">WORDLE</a>, a new word game, a kind of cross between Mastermind and Hangman, created by Josh Wardle. Wordle / Wardle: clever!</p>
<p>So of course, I played too, or rather I tried to play... Because I quickly had to admit that my English vocabulary was not enough to win regularly. Although I'm proud to follow series or movies in VO with English subtitles! Or maybe I have a big problem when it comes to 5 letter English words?</p>
<p>2 or 3 years ago, I had collected some French word lists to write a program that would allow me to optimize my Scrabble level (or cheat, if you want). In the end, I had never programmed anything.</p>
<p>But this weekend, after getting up at dawn around 10am, I went for it! And just after midnight, I had already code something pretty good that I was able to put online on my solitaire games site: <a href="https://www.solitaire-play.com/lemot/">https://www.solitaire-play.com/lemot/</a>. I was very happy because I didn't just adapt Josh Wardle's code, but I wrote my own version in Vanilla JS. And on top of that, I had come up with a great name: &quot;<strong>LeMOT</strong>&quot;. WORD-Le =&gt; Le-WORD =&gt; Le-MOT !</p>
<p>And I even had an idea for a slogan to complete the title: &quot;One Word, One Day&quot;, inspired by the french TV show &quot;One Book, One Day&quot;.</p>
<p>After that I went to sleep and the next day I just kept going and made a lot of improvements.</p>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted the backup of the game in progress, to be able to come back to it later when you are stuck.</li>
<li>Added a &quot;beta version&quot; watermark under the game title because I'm afraid of bugs :)</li>
<li>Minimized the JavaScript and CSS files to optimize loading.</li>
<li>Displayed the messages in some sort of &quot;flash&quot; popup (useful to tell if a word is unknown or to inform that the result at the end of the game has been copied to the clipboard to be pasted in Twitter or WhatsApp).</li>
<li>Updated the page content and the meta and Open Graph tags, with an image inspired by WORDLE.</li>
<li>Modified the export of the results in emoji to add the mention &quot;(beta)&quot; and a hashtag &quot;#LeMotLeJeu&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>This kept me busy until early afternoon. I didn't get back to it until the evening, to properly handle the color clues when there are duplicate letters, either in the word to guess or in the answers entered.</p>
<p>It was a lot of fun to do and no doubt I will continue to work on it.</p>
<p>Already, I have at least a couple of things to do to get my game right.</p>
<ul>
<li>On some phones, the last row of keys of the keyboard is not completely visible (especially when there are several tabs in a group and that partly hides the bottom of the keyboard).</li>
<li>To code quickly, I used Unicode characters to represent icons. They should be replaced by SVG to make it look nicer.</li>
<li>Check at what time the word is renewed. I use UTC dates and therefore in France, it should be at 1am.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then there are a few things to add to try to reproduce the original game's features as well as possible.</p>
<ul>
<li>Statistics: to make the game more attractive and encourage people to keep playing and seek for a great winning streak.</li>
<li>Have a button to explicitly share your result.</li>
<li>Handle settings to manage color sets adapted for people with visual difficulties or the &quot;dark mode&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another interesting task will be to limit the list of words offered as guesses. In the original version, Josh Wardle selected only 20% of the 12500 English 5-letter words to be among the happy few to guess. I'm not sure why he did this, and on what criteria. Probably their frequency of use. So, how can I do this in French?</p>
<p>In the meantime, feel free to test your French vocabulary on <a href="https://www.solitaire-play.com/lemot/">LeMOT - Un jeu de mot chaque jour</a>, to see if you can do better than me!</p>
