excerpt: I had to look up after the "Coquette" icons that I used a lot almost a decade ago.
---

I made a small modification on an old program to add a new button. Since this project is a bit old, it uses the "Coquette" icons that I liked at that time. It's a set of 450 pretty and very colorful icons, with a little casual side that made it easy to get a good quality user interface.

These icons are available in "old" formats (ICNS, ICO and PNG) and in several sizes (16x16px, 32x32px, 48x48px, 64x64px and 128x128px). I had a copy of all the icons in 24x24 pixels and I picked one from time to time. Then I changed my PC, switched to other icons and lost this backup.

As it was not easy to find all the icons proposed by [DryIcons](https://dryicons.com/), I write here the list of the 9 packs they had created:

* [https://dryicons.com/icon-packs/coquette-icons-set](https://dryicons.com/icon-packs/coquette-icons-set)
* [https://dryicons.com/icon-packs/coquette-part-2-icons-set](https://dryicons.com/icon-packs/coquette-part-2-icons-set)
* [https://dryicons.com/icon-packs/coquette-part-3-icons-set](https://dryicons.com/icon-packs/coquette-part-3-icons-set)
* [https://dryicons.com/icon-packs/coquette-part-4-icons-set](https://dryicons.com/icon-packs/coquette-part-4-icons-set)
* [https://dryicons.com/icon-packs/coquette-part-5-icons-set](https://dryicons.com/icon-packs/coquette-part-5-icons-set)
* [https://dryicons.com/icon-packs/coquette-part-6-icons-set](https://dryicons.com/icon-packs/coquette-part-6-icons-set)
* [https://dryicons.com/icon-packs/coquette-part-7-icons-set](https://dryicons.com/icon-packs/coquette-part-7-icons-set)
* [https://dryicons.com/icon-packs/coquette-part-8-icons-set](https://dryicons.com/icon-packs/coquette-part-8-icons-set)
* [https://dryicons.com/icon-packs/coquette-part-9-icons-set](https://dryicons.com/icon-packs/coquette-part-9-icons-set)

Maybe I could have upgrade to a modern set of icons, but that wasn't my goal. Plus, I realise that I still like them and that 10 years later they're almost retro...
