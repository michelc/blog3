title: "(Wdevs) IBuySpy Roles are not enough"
---

[ContentXML](http://www.hannonhill.com/) utilizes groups and
roles to manage content within the system. There are four primary roles:
contributor, approver, publisher, and administrator. Each of these roles has
certain rights that enable users to complete content updates. Groups are set to
organize what content is accessible by users within certain groups in the
company. An example would be a business analyst who would be in the marketing
group with access to marketing collateral and a contributor role, which
requires updates to be approved. This business analyst would not have access to
the financial group's files unless the analyst was also a member of the finance
group.

Primary takeaways:

* Roles modeled after organizational duties
* Groups modeled after organizational structure
* Content updated and added according to group and role
