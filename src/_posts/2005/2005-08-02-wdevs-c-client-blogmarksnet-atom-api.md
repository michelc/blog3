[Blogmarks.net](http://www.blogmarks.net/) is a free &amp; open
bookmarks manager based on keywords (aka Tags) and sharing. With Blogmarks.net
you'll be able to store and share with other users your favorite websites
trough a "blog-like" technology. Your bookmarks will now be available from any
internet connection and accessible from a variety of others services trough our
API.

I just upload a [c# client](http://dev.blogmarks.net/wiki/BlogmarksCSharpClient) in the
developper wiki. It was a great exercise to make [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST) with c#.
