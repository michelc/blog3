Quest Software has released TOAD for MySQL. That would be great if they
succeeded to make it as good as TOAD for Oracle. Currently, I was
<s>using</s> trying to use MySQL-Front, but it drives me crazy.

They offer [TOAD
for MySQL](http://www.toadsoft.com/toadmysql/toad_mysql.htm) as a freeware release. The only drawback is that every 60 days
it's necessary to download and install it again. And as there is a [TOAD for SQL
Server](http://www.toadsoft.com/toadsqlserver/toad_sqlserver.htm) too I will have to work again at the MSDE version of my portal.
