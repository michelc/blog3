> In this chapter, you built most of the core infrastructure needed for the
> SportsStore application. It doesn't yet have many features you could show off
> to your boss or client, but behind the scenes you've got the beginnings of a
> domain model, with a product repository backed by a SQL Server database.
> There's a single MVC controller, ProductsController, that can produce a paged
> list of products, and there's a DI container that coordinates the dependencies
> between all these pieces. Plus, there's a clean custom URL schema, and you're
> now starting to build the application code on a solid foundation of unit
> tests.
