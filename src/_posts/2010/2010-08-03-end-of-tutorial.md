> You've now seen how ASP.NET MVC can be used to create a realistic e-commerce
> application. This extended example demonstrated many of the framework's
> features (controllers, actions, routing, views and partials, model binding,
> metadata, validation, master pages, and Forms Authentication) and related
> technologies (LINQ to SQL, Ninject for DI, and NUnit and Moq for unit testing).
> You've made use of clean, component-oriented architecture to separate out the
> application's concerns, keeping it simple to understand and maintain.
