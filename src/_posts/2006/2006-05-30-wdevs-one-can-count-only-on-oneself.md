After the publication of the site for [Arsac Voyages](http://www.arsac-tourisme.com/), I could note that it was
not so easy to reference a website.

It's not a problem with the major search engine like Google, Msn Search or
Yahoo. And it's ok with Dmoz too.

No, that becomes a deal when you want your site to appear on more local
directories. In my case, I naturally wished to record it on directories about
Ardèche.

And there, it's not very brilliant compared to search engine :

* many directories imperatively requires a back link
* a majority make only a redirection to your site (like goto.php?id=12345)
and not a good old true real hard link
* there are also all those directories where you have to pay

What has also surprised me, it's the little number of links which these
directories contain :

* some are really ridiculous with less than one about fifty links which
display only after a long travel in an infernal tree structure
* in the best cases, most serious directories posts between 200 and 300
links, which seemed to me very poor : Ardeche is a "small" department, but
not at this point :)

And to crown the whole, the process to submit a new site is not always very
simple but on the other hand it's generally take several weeks to be
recorded!

What has to arrive arrived. And I said to myself : I am not so stupid!
I can make with QC a better directory than all these things.

Et voila, after a little programming and much input, there is not one but
two new sites built with QC :

* [07-Ardeche.com - l'annuaire de
l'Ardèche](http://07-ardeche.com/) : my directory for [Ardèche](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardèche) websites,
* [69.pagesd.info - l'annuaire du
Rhône](http://69.pagesd.info/) : Fred's directory for [Rhône](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhône_(département))
websites.

And once again, thanks to the magic of QC (and CSS :), its possible to
obtain two different layout with tyhe same code base.

Edit : and [74 - Haute-Savoie -
l'annuaire de la Haute-Savoie](http://74.pagesd.info/) : Philippe's directory for [Haute-Savoie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haute-Savoie) websites.
