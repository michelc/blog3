I must admit that I didn't really succeed in holding my starting objective
which was to track my work as I develop another IBuySpy clone.

On the other hand, I succeeded in holding my development
objectives :

* QC provide [standard xhtml code]({% post_url 2004-10-22-wdevs-start %})
and use CSS compliant templates,
* [a Private
Assembly architecture]({% post_url 2004-11-02-wdevs-project-fundations %}) with qc.Engine.dll and qc.Classics.dll (with 32 boxes
!!!),
* the data layer works with Access, Sql Server, Oracle, MySQL and PostgreSQL
(although that made a few months that I didn't test with MySQL and
PostgreSQL).

And I have also the excuse to have more or less writed the main step of
development on my French weblog.

Today, we use QC as a framework to build web applications in the company
where I work. So it's OK as an intranet/portal engine. On the "CMS" side, it's
not really deployed. We still doing in-house testing (eating our own dog
food).

* Frederic was the first to use it build a site for his village of [Condrieu](http://condrieu.au-quotidien.info/), famous for his "Côtes du
Rhône" wines.
* Since this weekend, Philippe has followed him to put on line a site for la
[Compagnie Peretti](http://www.compagnie-peretti.com/), which
realize theater spectacles and puppet show intended to the children.

Normally, this list should increase in the weeks to come (at least of 1 site
:).
