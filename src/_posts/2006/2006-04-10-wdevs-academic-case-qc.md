It's done! I finally put on line the site of the company of [autocars in Ard√®che](http://www.arsac-tourisme.com/) (near Aubenas) where
my sister works. I'm very proud of it because I entirely build the layout
template rather than to re-use a free one. I start with the [Skidoo Too
layout](http://webhost.bridgew.edu/etribou/layouts/skidoo_too/index.html) and by feeding my inspiration from several sources, I imagined a
clean and modern design. For me, it proves that QC (with the help of Skidoo
Too) is really effective for versatile CSS design. That also shows that the use
of the CSS brings a true added value since the site [displays perfectly with all browsers](http://browsershots.org/).

I worked so that the update of the contents is the easiest possible, without
sacrificing too much to the design. For example, there are blocks for the
conditions of each travel. The display is pretty sophisticated, but they are
very simple to edit. All that the writer have to do, it's to use the wysiwyg
editor to set an `<h3>` tag for the travel title and an `<h4>` tag for the price.
You can [see the
result](http://www.arsac-tourisme.com/journees.aspx) on the page for the travels in one day.

One of my other reasons for satisfaction, it is that all the pages of the
site are [Valid
XHTML 1.0 Transitional!](http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http://www.arsac-tourisme.com/) and that all CSS are [
almost OK](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=http://www.arsac-tourisme.com/&amp;warning=no&amp;profile=css3&amp;usermedium=all), with the exception of a hack in Skidoo Too which "keeps IE from
breaking horribly under narrow viewports".

From today, I can consider that a new stage is reached for QC.
