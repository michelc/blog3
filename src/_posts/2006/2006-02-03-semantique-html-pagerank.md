[Mike
Davidson](http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2006/01/the-roundabout-seo-test) tried to rank for the term lodefizzle on Google. He wrote a dozen
different pages to find out what aspects of HTML Google really cares about.
Scroll down to the Google…

* The H1 tag does indeed assert some dominance and we can therefore assume
you are better off using proper headings in your HTML documents.
* The mere appearance of many nested tables in your code does not have a
strong enough negative effect to be considered a drag on search engine
ranking.
* It's not clear that validity helps search engine ranking, but it's
definitely true that certain errors in your code can get you completely removed
from indexes.
* The semantic effect of hierarchical HTML headings is a stronger factor in
search rankings than more rudimentary measures such as physical keyword
placement.
* Although good semantics are somewhat valuable in optimization, simple
things like proper titles, descriptive filenames, and incoming links are
dramatically more important.
