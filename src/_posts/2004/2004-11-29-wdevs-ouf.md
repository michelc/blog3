For a few days, my project didn't function any more on monoForge.

It was entirely my fault. I referred a dll to use the Google Api for future
tests. I use this dll since a so long time that I don't remember any more when
and how I compiled it. It can just be for .Net 1.0 or in debug mode. Yesterday
I had an illumination and I removed it from my project. This mornig I upload
all the project and now [
it works again](http://web.archive.org/web/20041215050806/http://michel.monoforge.com/default.aspx?idScreen=tests).

If I have a little time this week, I will be able to continue my tests.
