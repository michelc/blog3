[Miguel](http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/archive/2004/Oct-21.html)
speaks about [monoForge](http://www.monoforge.com/), a site where
you can test your ASP.NET application on Linux. And host is free during the
beta period.

Consequently, I wonder whether I rather will not build a portal which runs
under mono, even if there is already [one](http://mojoportal.monoforge.com/). But I don't have much experiment
with MySql and it would be necessary that I install it on my PC.
