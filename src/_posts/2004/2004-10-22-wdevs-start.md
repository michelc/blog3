I plan to use this weblog to track my work as I will develop a light portal
starting from IBuySpy. Compared to other portals, my intention is to privilege
a more standard html code and in particular not to use tables but css for the
presentation. I expect to use [Skidoo
Too](http://webhost.bridgew.edu/etribou/layouts/skidoo_too/index.html) for the 3 columns layout.

Of course, it's the idylic path. Perhaps that when DotNetNuke3 ships, I
would decide to adopt it and develop some modules according to my criteria.
